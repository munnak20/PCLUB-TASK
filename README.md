## PCLUB-TASK
  
  This is a PClub task for a project in which i have to design a Lender-Borrower system.
I have used oops concept in c++.
  
  I have made two class, one is  class borrower which will contains name of borrowers and money needed to them and other is class lender which will contain its pay capacity(balance), name and due of borrowers;
  
  I have defined function(pay) for paying the request of borrowers and it will also take record of name and due to borrowers. it will also update the balance;
  
  I have defined a function(print) for printing final status of lender.
